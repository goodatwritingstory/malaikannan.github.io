  Hi this is Malaikannan Sankarasubbu. This is my personal page, opinions expressed here are mine not of my employers. You will find my ramblings about technology, politics, philosphy and sports. I am a programmer, been programming for about 12 years now. I use to love Object oriented programming, but have crossed over to the dark side of functional programming and scripting. I can rave about how good Python is as a Programming Language all day long. I love Artificial Intelligence, i am active in the Deep Learning community. If I didn't meet my wife in Scranton airport, i would have moved to Alaska and probably you would have seen me in the outdoor shows with me riding a snowmobile in dead of Alaskan winter. I have a young family, my handsome and intelligent son is 5 years old, i am married to my beautiful wife for 6 years now. I am founder and CTO at Datalog.ai where i get to work on cool artificial intellegience problems
