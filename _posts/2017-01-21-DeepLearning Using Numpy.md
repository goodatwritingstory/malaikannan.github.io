DeepLearning has been getting lot of good press for the past 1 year. I am a CTO at Datalog.ai  where we solve lot of cool problems using Deep Learning . ML Researchers and Engineers use lot of Deep Learning packages like Theano, Tensorflow, Torch, Keras etc. Packages are really good but when you want to get an understanding on how Deep Learning works, it is better to go back to basics and understand how it is done. This blog is at an attempt at that, it is going to be a 3 part of series with topics being

1. DeepLearning using Numpy
2. Why TensorFlow/Theano not Numpy?
3. Why Keras not TensorFlow/Theano?
