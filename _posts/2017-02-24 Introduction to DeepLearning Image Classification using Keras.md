DeepLearning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve lot of problems. I can't solve all the problems in this world, if I can inspire few others to take Deep Learning to solve other problems it will make a positive impact in this society. I believe in spreading knowledge to all segments. Below is the youtube link for a talk i gave in Demystifying Artificial Intelligence conference couple of weeks back

I am part of IDLI group (Indian Deep Learning Initiative) which is trying get DeepLearning promoted in India. We are organizing lot of youtube live sessions. I gave the same talk with screen sharing. If you like to see code when someone is talking and not presenters face then this youtube link is for you
